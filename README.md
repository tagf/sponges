To reproduce the results, you might want to install Anaconda https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
(automatically includes Python3, Spyder 4, and IPython Notebook support with JupyterNotebook / JupyterLab) on your computer.

Alternatively you can try JupyterLab online: https://jupyter.org/try or https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb
Click File, then Upload or create a new notebook,
paste the code from one of our compuptations into a code cell of the notebook and run it.
